This is a trial code challenge for Vision Link.

I have placed a word document showing you how it all works based upon the instructions. The file can be found in
"docs/trial-task.docx".

If you want to setup a your own environment you need to setup an Apacle vhost with the name of "visionlink.test".

You will want to be able to bring up http://visionlink.test in your browser.

Next you will want to set up a test Postgres database with a user account called "visionlink" and a database called 
"visionlink". See file "private/visionlink" which contains your creditionals. If you already have a Postgres database
set up then you can just change the values in the "private/visionlink" file.
