<p>
This is a trial code challenge for Vision Link.

I have placed a word document showing you how it all works based upon the instructions. The file can be found in
"docs/trial-task.docx".

Set up a test Postgres database with a user account called "visionlink" and a database called "visionlink". 
See file "private/visionlink" which contains your creditionals. If you already have a Postgres database
set up then you can just change the values in the "private/visionlink" file.
