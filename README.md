The program is setup in an Apache vhost so it has it own private server on my local laptop. The reason for this
is that I have several web projects going on in my laptop and this prevents me from having to move things 
around if I want to work on a project. The domain name of "visionlink.test" is want I use and there are
a few urls with "http://visionlink.test" hardcoded in the program. For a finished product I will change it
so it could easily run under any domain name you choose.

There is a database file under private/ called visionlink. This file contains the database access information.

See the .DOCX Word doc under docs/trial-task.docs which will show you what it is suppose to do.
